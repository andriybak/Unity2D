Game is in first try early alpha state.

* Todos:
** Ball bounce should be improved so it does not lose velocity on some weird bounce direction. (Add some collision logic to monitor vecolity)
** Level design should be improved. currently only 1 preset is used for level 1 - 5 and one for level 6 and 7.
** Increase bonuses in game?
** Use different varuiabtions of blocks (currently 3 types, easy, medium and hard) current preset only uses easy.
** ????
